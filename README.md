# Applications of `Machine Learning`

Currently, almost everything we use is already using **Machine Learning (ML)** in some way, for example: whenever you post on **Facebook**, it already knows who your friends are in the photo and automatically tags them, this implies another application which is **Recognition Facial** that is being widely adopted. This is an example that almost everyone has seen, but we can mention others, such as: the **X-Box Kinect**, which analyzes your actions and reproduces them in the game you are playing and the name of the algorithm used in this scenario isc alled the **Forest Random**, we can also quote **Netflix** with it's system of recommendations for films and series, which learns from the informations provided, such as the time you spend watching a specific program, which were marked with like or deslike, **Virtual Stores** also use the Machine Learning **to offer new products** according to your consumption or visualizations, the keyboard of your SmartPhone learns while you type your messages or surveys, **Virtual Reality (VR)** glasses, Machine Learning is also use to save lives, helping to detect cancer and making new drugs, vaccines and other things that would take a long time if only humans wre analyzed.

I can cite many other examples, but I suggest paying close attention to the behavior of the tools you use on a daily basis and if you notice that it seems to know you very well or that it makes very accurate predictions, this will probably indicate that this tool is using Machine Learning in some part of it's functioning.
